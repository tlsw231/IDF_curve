This notebook shows how to leverage the powerful [map_blocks](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/generated/xarray.map_blocks.html) function in `Xarray` to parallelize calculations across a global dataset. It is inspired by this set of [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FItPMwK4K1o) showing how to compute IDF curves by fitting Generalized Extreme Value distributions using numpy and scipy. The present notebook is closely based on those videos but operates within an [Xarray](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/index.html) framework. But the primary contribution of this notebook is the use of `map_blocks`. The dataset analyzed here is a 6-hourly timeseries of precipitation from a high-resolution CESM pre-industrial "control" simulation. The analysis covers a duration of 51 years (1970-2021)
