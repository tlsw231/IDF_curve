This notebook shows how to leverage the powerful [map_blocks](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/generated/xarray.map_blocks.html) function in [Xarray](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/index.html) to calculate the Intensity-Duration-Frequency curves (IDF) for precipitation, by parallelizing calculations across a global dataset. It is inspired by this set of [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FItPMwK4K1o) showing how to compute the IDF curves by fitting Generalized Extreme Value distributions using numpy and scipy. The present notebook is guided by those videos but operates within an `Xarray` framework. The primary contribution of this notebook is the use of `map_blocks`. The dataset analyzed here is a **6-hourly timeseries** of precipitation from a high-resolution **CESM pre-industrial "control" simulation**. The analysis covers a duration of **51 years** (1970-2021)
