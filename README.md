This is a Jupyter notebook inspired by this set of nice [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FItPMwK4K1o) showing how to compute IDF curve by fitting GEV distributions using numpy and scipy. The present notebook is closely based on those videos but operates within an [Xarray](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/index.html) framework. The more substantial contribution of this notebook is the use of the powerful [map_blocks](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/generated/xarray.map_blocks.html) function from Xarray to parallelize the calculation over the entire globe. Here the dataset analyzed is a 6-hourly timeseries of precipitation from a high-resolution CESM pre-industrial "control" simulation. The analysis covers a duration of 51 years (1970-2021)
